                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>
                        The gorilla, a magnificent and powerful primate, inhabits the dense forests and mountainous regions of central Africa. Known for its immense strength and gentle nature, the gorilla is the largest living primate, with adult males, known as silverbacks due to the silver-gray hair on their backs, weighing up to 200 kilograms (440 pounds) or more. Females are smaller, typically weighing around half as much as males. Gorillas are characterized by their robust build, muscular arms, and large hands with opposable thumbs, which they use skillfully to manipulate objects and forage for food

                       Their thick, dark fur provides insulation against the cool mountain climates where some species live, while those in lower-altitude forests have shorter fur adapted to a warmer environment. Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, with their diet consisting mainly of leaves, shoots, fruits, and occasionally insects. They are known for their gentle demeanor within social groups called troops, led by a dominant silverback who ensures the safety and cohesion of the group.

                        Gorillas exhibit complex social behaviors, including grooming, playing, and vocal communication through a variety of grunts, barks, and chest-beating displays. Despite their formidable appearance, gorillas are generally non-aggressive and prefer to resolve conflicts through displays of strength rather than physical confrontation. They are highly intelligent animals, capable of using tools and showing a remarkable level of empathy and understanding within their social groups. Gorillas are also crucial to their ecosystems as seed dispersers, helping to maintain the biodiversity of the forests they inhabit.
