                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>
                        The giraffe, with its towering height and distinctive coat pattern, is a majestic creature that roams the savannas and woodlands of Africa. Known for being the tallest land animal, its elongated neck allows it to reach the highest branches of trees, where it feeds on leaves and buds. The pattern of its coat, a patchwork of irregular spots and patches, serves as effective camouflage among the trees and bushes of its habitat. Despite its remarkable stature, the giraffe moves with surprising grace and agility, its long legs carrying it swiftly across the African plains. Gentle giants by nature, giraffes often gather in loose groups, called towers, peacefully browsing and keeping watch for predators like lions and hyenas. Their curious nature and gentle demeanor make them a symbol of the wild beauty and resilience of Africa's vast landscapes.

                        The giraffe stands as the tallest living terrestrial animal, with adult males reaching heights of up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) and females typically slightly shorter. Their incredible height is largely due to their long necks, which can measure up to 2.4 meters (8 feet) in length and account for almost half of their total height. Despite their towering stature, giraffes are surprisingly lightweight for their size, with males weighing between 1,200 to 1,930 kilograms (2,600 to 4,250 pounds) and females ranging from 700 to 1,180 kilograms (1,540 to 2,600 pounds).

                        In addition to their distinctive height and weight, giraffes possess unique physical characteristics such as their long, dark tongues measuring around 45-50 centimeters (18-20 inches), perfectly adapted for plucking leaves from tall trees. Their coat features a patchwork of irregular spots and patches that provide effective camouflage against the dappled light and shadows of the savanna. These patterns are unique to each individual giraffe, much like human fingerprints.
