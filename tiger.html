                    <h3>TIGER</h3>
                    <p>
                      The tiger, known for its majestic appearance and formidable presence, is the largest of the big cats and a symbol of strength and grace. Found primarily in forests and grasslands across Asia, tigers are characterized by their striking orange coat with black stripes, unique to each individual. They are solitary hunters, stalking prey such as deer, wild boar, and occasionally larger animals like buffalo or young elephants. Tigers are incredibly powerful, capable of bringing down prey several times their size with a single pounce.

                        Despite their fearsome reputation, tigers are also remarkably stealthy and elusive, preferring to avoid human contact whenever possible. They are predominantly nocturnal hunters, relying on their keen senses of sight and hearing to locate prey in the darkness. Tigers are apex predators in their ecosystems, playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance of prey populations.

                        Conservation efforts are critical for the survival of tigers, as they are classified as endangered by the IUCN due to habitat loss, poaching for their pelts and body parts, and human-wildlife conflict. Protected reserves and anti-poaching measures are essential for safeguarding remaining tiger populations and ensuring their continued existence in the wild. Tigers are not only iconic symbols of wildlife conservation but also serve as ambassadors for the preservation of their habitats and the biodiversity they support.
